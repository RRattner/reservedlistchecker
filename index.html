<!--This project uses an API called Scryfall to check if a card from the game Magic: The Gathering is on the reserved list.  Users enter the card name,
then we call the Scryfall API to look for it.  If we can find it (so no error and finding only one card) then we take the card's image and check if it's
on the reserved list, and then report if it is or is not.-->

    <span id = "explanation" style = "text-align: center;">Welcome to the Reserved List Card Checker!  This is a tool you can use to see if a card from Magic: The Gathering is on the Reserved List.<br>
        The Reserved List is a list of cards that the makers of Magic: The Gathering have promised not to reprint or make obsolete.  To use this tool,<br>
        enter the name of a Magic: The Gathering card into the Card Name area and click search.  If you aren't familiar with the game but would like<br>
        to test the tool, here are some search options:<br>
        <br>
        Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite<br>
        Badlands<br>
        Zuberi, Golden Feather<br>
        Restoration Angel<br>
        Nethroi, Apex of Death<br>
        Haughty Djinn<br>
        Mox Pearl<br>
        <br>
        This tool is powered with the Scryfall API.<br><br>
    </span>
    <!--This code is used to create the elements the user will be seeing.  "onTheReservedList" isn't assigned anything until a search is done, at which point it will
    be assigned either a statement as to whether or not the searched card is on the reserved list, or a statement alerting the user that the card couldn't be found.
    The image is "Blank Card" until a valid card is searched, at which point it is redefined to have that card's image.  searchCard is our function to call the
    Scryfall API to check for our card-->
